# Gymify
## Gameifying the gyn-going experience

### The Idea

The idea is to build an app that gameifies the gym-going experience.
I, as many other people have, struggled with starting to go to the gym, as somedays
I wasn't motivated at all to go, so I just ended up staying at home. With this,
in the next day I even forgot completely about the gym, so I just couldn't
build the habit of going.

During my most recent attempt to get back into working out, I thought: well,
to learn a new language, I just use Duolingo, an app that reminds me to train
my language skills everyday, and inserts many fun aspects into language learning,
so why isn't there the same thing for the gym?

This is what I want to accomplish, a mobile app that motivates people to train,
by giving them streak of how many days they train, and giving them points for
sticking to their objectives.

If the application scales, it would also be interesting to create leaderboards,
to show motivational quotes, and to show fitness-related articles and videos.
